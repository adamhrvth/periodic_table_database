# Periodic table database: PostgreSQL and Bash scripting project
#### FreeCodeCamp's relational database certification project (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-periodic-table-database-project/build-a-periodic-table-database).
This is my solution for FCC's relational database project. The task was to create a Bash script wherewith a user can get information about an element based on it's atomic number, symbol or name. The elements and the properties of those are stored in a PostgreSQL database.
